## Hi there,
I'm René, a passionate and curious game developer from the Netherlands. I would consider myself an intermediate programmer and I especially love programming physics, tools, and systems. I also have some experience in 3D modeling and texturing.
Some personal interests are physics, philosophy, skateboarding, Dungeons and Dragons, Esports (I am currently on the 9th board of the Esports Student Association Blueshell at the University of Twente) and I love to watch animated series :).  
Below you can find some of my relevant projects. If you want to see more from me, you can check out some of my other links too:
